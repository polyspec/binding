## Unreleased

- Node refused a member that takes a function type (GN-6m). It now holds the JavaScript function as a `Native` of
  its owner table (GN-6o) and declares the parameter as a TypeScript function type; a call runs on the owner thread in
  the env of the table, and a call on another thread is kind `wrong_thread`, which the entry point `__threadTest` of
  the new feature `thread-test` shows. A value that is not a function is kind `invalid_argument_type`. The generated
  tests give a function value of a case as the call of a fixture.
- The generated bindings kept every language object that entered as a handle in a table that only grew: Python and
  WASM for the life of the process, Node for the life of the thread, PHP until the request ended. A `Date` and an
  `Other` value were kept the same way, and Go walked a func only inside its call. A language object that a core may
  keep now enters as a `Native` whose last drop releases it by the rule of its target (GN-6o): Python holds the
  `Py<PyAny>` and refuses `pyo3_disable_reference_pool`; WASM holds the key of its table; Node and PHP hold the owner,
  its generation and the key, queue a drop on another thread for the owner, empty that queue in `guard` at every entry
  point, and release the table and raise the generation at the env cleanup hook and at the request shutdown; Go holds
  the `cgo.Handle` of the func and gives a new one for each `out`. A `Date` and an `Other` value get a handle numbered
  in the order of the call. The data alias of `tests/e2e/sample` keeps an object or a function as `Data::Native` and
  gives it back by the `native` row in every target; `generate.test.ts` checks the form of each target.
- binding_core gave a language object that a core may keep, a `HostValue::Object`, a `HostValue::Callable` or an
  `OutValue::Native`, as a `Handle` into a table of the binding that kept every object until the end of the process
  or the request, because nothing told the binding when the core dropped the handle. It now gives it as a `Native`,
  an `Arc<dyn NativeObject>` that is equal by its object and releases what the binding keeps for the object when the
  core drops the last one (B-1, U-7 (d)). `HostValue::Object` names the field `native`. `tests/native.rs` checks the
  equality, a clone and the release on another thread. Verified by `make test-rust lint-rust`.
- A member that calls language code that its receiver keeps, such as `registry.call` of `tests/e2e/functions`,
  whose core returns `Result<T, Failure<E>>`, was generated as if its core error were `E`, so the binding crate did
  not compile (E0308). The contract now names such a member with `core.failure: true`, whose error the generated code
  converts as that of a member that takes a callback; `binding check` refuses `core.failure: true` on a member whose
  receiver keeps no language code, `core.failure: false` on a member that takes a callback or a function, and
  `core.failure: true` with `core.result: false` (E-1c, GN-7, CK-21). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A parameter that held a callback inside another type, an item of a list, an `optional` or a field of a record
  parameter, was refused for every target ("the type {"unit": ...} is not generated yet"). Each target now gives the
  core such a callback as `Box<dyn <core trait> + 'a>` and the list, the `optional` or the record by value, `'a` being
  `'env` in Node and `'static` elsewhere; the core type of a record with a callback field has that lifetime, and such a
  record is refused by name at a place other than a record parameter (GN-6n). A generated test gives a callback value
  inside another value as the object of a fixture, or an instance value of a class that implements the callback.
  `tests/e2e/sample` has `sample.first` (a list), `sample.maybe` (an `optional`) and `sample.seek` (a record field).
  Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A case that gave a function value `{"function": [<row>]}` stopped the generator with "no case value of the type".
  A Python test now gives it as a fixture of the call itself, whose record of calls the test reads after the call, or,
  inside another value such as an argument of a `then` call, as the callable of such a fixture; and it checks that a
  value that is not callable is kind `invalid_argument_type` (G-5, GN-6m). `tests/e2e/functions` is a Python
  repository whose core calls a function during the call (`functions.apply`) and keeps one in a class
  (`registry.register`, `registry.call`).
- A member with a parameter of a function type was refused for every target ("the type {"function": ...} is not
  generated yet"), so a contract with one, such as template `engine.register`, generated no target. Python now
  generates it: the core takes `Box<dyn Fn(<parameter>…) -> Result<R, binding_core::Failure<E>> + Send + Sync>` by
  value, the callable is checked as it enters (kind `invalid_argument_type`), and a call converts the arguments out
  and the result in, with an exception of the Python code going to the core as a `Raised` (GN-6m). Node, PHP and WASM
  refuse it by name until binding_core has the native lifetime, and Go refuses it. The callback members and the
  function types share one rule of borrowed parameters (T-1). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A core with fault injection points ran `cargo test` with its points off unless the repository gave a flag or a
  dev-dependency of its own, and repositories did it in two forms. The core now has itself as a dev-dependency with
  `fault-test`, so `cargo test` without flags arms its points, and `binding check` reports a core manifest without it
  (CK-65, GN-5). The sample core of tests/e2e has that dev-dependency.
- A case that gave an instance value as an item of a list of a class, or as an argument of a class type of the call
  under test, stopped the generator with "no case value of the type". The value of a class at any place of a case is
  now an instance value, which each target makes at its place (GN-13f). `tests/e2e/classes` has such cases of
  `classes.join` and `tag.same`. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The generator refused the Go binding of a contract with a class unit, a callback unit, a value alias (also of
  another repository), a value alias with `in_raises`, a `source` parameter, a parameter or field with a default, an
  error unit, or fault injection points, so `tests/e2e/classes`, `tests/e2e/shapes`, `tests/e2e/sample` and
  `tests/e2e/consumer` failed on Go before anything was built. Go now generates each of them: a class as a struct over a handle of a locked table with `New<Class>`, static functions
  `<Class><Member>`, methods, an iterator and `String()` (GN-15a); a callback as an interface whose error comes back as
  the same value (GN-15b); a value alias as `any` that the core reads through questions to Go (GN-15c); an error unit
  as a struct that embeds its parent (GN-15d); a `source` as `[]byte` and a default as a nil pointer (GN-15e); and the
  entry points of `fault-test`, of `codec-test` for an alias and of the poison test. The generated Go tests are in the
  package itself and cover U-2, U-7, K-2, B-4 with the exact error unit, GN-13e, N-4 and B-5c, the cases that arm faults
  with the build tag `polyspec_fault_test` (GN-13b). `binding check` names a static member of a class among the names
  of its Go package (CK-13), and the end-to-end check runs `go test` with a tag for each test feature of the crate and
  finds every test entry point in a library built without features. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- `binding scaffold` wrote an allow attribute wider than 70 columns with each argument on a line of its own, the form of
  the defaults of rustfmt, so `cargo fmt --check` of a repository with `use_small_heuristics = "Max"` and `max_width =
  120` failed on the `src/lib.rs` of each binding crate, which those settings join into one line. An allow attribute
  is now one line of at most 80 columns, which both forms keep, and a reason that does not fit is the comment above it;
  the reason of the Node addon names its rule id (GN-3a, GN-4).
- The generator refused an error unit of a module other than the root for every target. It now generates it: PHP
  registers the class in the namespace of its module, Python gives it from `<root>.<module>` and `<root>`, and Node and
  WASM export it by its name (GN-7a, GN-11). The error unit `utf8_error` of tests/e2e/shapes is in the module
  `errors`, so the end-to-end check raises it through each target.
- A record parameter with the default `{empty: "object"}` was refused for every target ("a default of a record
  parameter is not generated yet"), so a contract with one, such as `parse(source, options = {})`, generated no
  target. Such a parameter is generated when every field of the record has a default: the core takes the record with
  every field `None`, Python and PHP leave out the keywords and named arguments of the fields, and Node and WASM take
  the options record as a trailing argument that may be missing or `undefined`; a record with a field without a
  default is refused by name (GN-6i). `tests/e2e/shapes` has the member `shapes.wrap` of this form. Verified by
  `npm test` in `packages/ts` and `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/shapes`.
- The Makefile had no target for the unit tests, so the tests of packages/ts and of binding_core ran only as commands
  of their packages. `make test-ts` type-checks packages/ts and runs its tests, `make test-rust` tests binding_core
  with all features and with none, `make lint-rust` runs clippy in both forms and checks the format, and `make check`
  runs the three to their end and names each failed one.
- `binding generate` ended a refused target, after it had written the other targets, with the usage line and status 2,
  as if the command line were wrong, so a repository could not tell the refusal from a usage error. A refusal, a core
  manifest that is not the crate of the contract and a failed `cargo metadata` now end with status 1 and no usage
  line; only an error of the command line prints the usage with status 2 (GN-1c).
- A fault injection point was judged by the feature `fault-test` of binding_core, which Cargo unifies across a build,
  so one core with `fault-test` turned on the points of every core: a binding crate that left
  `polyspec-<library>/fault-test` out of its feature passed the cases that arm the points of that library. A point
  is now the macro `fault::point!`, which is judged by the feature `fault-test` of the crate that writes it, and
  `tests/point.rs` builds two cores and a binding that turns on the feature of one of them (GN-5). A core writes
  `binding_core::fault::point!(NAME)` in place of `binding_core::fault::point(NAME)`.
- A member that raises and takes a function, or a callback inside another type, was reported as waiting for a case
  form, so its kinds had no case (CK-22). A case gives a function as `{"function": [<row>]}`, whose `args` are the
  positions of its parameters, and a callback at any place of a callback type as its fixture, or as an instance value
  of a class that implements the interface; `binding check` judges each as it judges a fixture (CK-22, GN-13). The
  generator still refuses a function type and a callback inside another type by name (GN-13a). Verified by `npm test`
  in `packages/ts`.
- A call of `then` in an instance value that fails stopped the test as a failure of its preparation, so a kind that
  only an instance after a failed call reaches, such as a failure that a body gives again, had no case. A call of
  `then` may name `"raises": {"kind": <kind>}`, a kind of its member's `raises`, which `binding check` judges and every
  target requires before the next step (GN-13f, CK-22). `tests/e2e/classes` has such a case of `gate.enter`. Verified
  by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A case gave any value at a place of the type `cancel` without a finding, so a kind that only a cancellation that
  fired before the call reaches had no case form. A case gives it as `{"cancel": "fired"}`, or `{"cancel": "open"}`
  for one that does not fire, and `binding check` reports any other value (CK-22). Verified by `npm test` in
  `packages/ts`.
- An `out` row of a value alias whose `make` names a member was refused, so a value whose language form is an
  instance of a class of the contract had no binding. A row by a constructor or static member of a generated class
  whose one parameter is the content of the kind and which cannot fail now calls its core path on that content, and
  the value leaves as an instance of the class; any other member is refused by name (GN-6e). Verified by `npm test`
  in `packages/ts`.
- An `out` row of a value alias whose `make` is `{"keyed_map": {"key": [...]}}` was refused as a form that is not
  generated, so a value alias that gives a map of keys that are no sequence as a keyed map had no binding in any
  language. The row is now made as a map whose keys, of the kinds it lists, are made by the rows of the alias as its
  items are (GN-6e). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The check did not judge the integers of a case at a place of the type `int` or `uint`, so a case that gave
  9223372036854775807 to an `int` parameter passed the check, which Python and PHP took as an i64 and Node and WASM
  refused as kind `invalid_number`. The check now reports an integer of a case outside the safe integers at such a
  place (CK-64).
- The Node and WASM declarations named an `int64` parameter `number | bigint` and an `int64` result `bigint`, but the
  binding took and gave a number of the safe integers only, so the case 9223372036854775807 was refused as an
  argument, and `binding` read that integer of a case file as the nearest double. The binding now takes a `bigint` of
  the range of i64 and gives a `bigint`, and `binding` reads an integer outside the safe integers as a `bigint`
  (GN-12a). A method whose name meets a lint convention (`from_end`) failed clippy in the Python and PHP crates, and a
  bool field went to a WASM conversion by a needless borrow; a method has the Rust name `member_<name>` with its
  language name as an attribute, and a scalar field is passed by value (GN-6l). `tests/e2e/shapes` has the members
  `shapes.measure`, `shapes.negate` and `buffer.from_end` for these forms. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts` and
  `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/shapes`.
- A case could give a value of a value type only as JSON nested once per level, so a value deeper than the default
  limit of a JSON reader (PHP 512, serde_json 128) could not be written, and a kind that only such a value raises had
  no case (CK-22). A case gives it as `{"kind": "list", "repeat": <n>, "value": <value>}`, which each test makes in a
  loop (G-5). The table of built-in forms named no Go type of `keyed_map`, so the contract check reported that Go has
  no built-in keyed_map value (CK-8) although Go has `*KeyedMap[T]` (GN-15); the table names `*KeyedMap[any]`.
  Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A case could not give a text that is not well formed, because a JSON text holds only well-formed text, so a kind
  that only such a text raises had no case (CK-22). A case gives it as `{"ill_formed": "<text>"}`: the text and an
  unpaired surrogate in Python, Node and WASM, or the byte 0xFF in PHP and Go (G-5). Verified by `npm test` in
  `packages/ts`.
- `tests/e2e/consumer` had no runner of its contract cases for WASM, so the end-to-end run checked the value alias of
  another repository and the callback on WASM by the generated tests alone, while Node ran the contract cases too.
  `tests/e2e/consumer/cases.wasm.test.mjs` runs the same cases through the subpath `./wasm`. Verified by `make e2e` of
  `tests/e2e/consumer` with `DEPS=tests/e2e/sample`.
- The generator refused the WASM binding of a contract with a value alias (U-7), with a value alias of another
  repository, with an alias that has `in_raises`, or with a callback unit (U-3), so `tests/e2e/sample` and
  `tests/e2e/consumer` failed on WASM before anything was built. The WASM module now describes a JavaScript value as the
  `HostValue` of the rule of Node and makes a core value by the alias's `out` rows (GN-18b), calls every JavaScript
  operation of the description that may run code of the value with `catch`, so its exception is thrown again unchanged
  and never unwinds through the module, runs the `in` function of an alias alone through `__aliasIn<Alias>` of the
  feature `codec-test`, which the WASM crate now has, and generates a callback as a struct over the JavaScript object
  whose exception reaches the caller as the same object (GN-18c). The generated WASM tests have the tests of K-2, the
  callback fixtures of a case and the U-7 tests of an alias (GN-13c). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The cores of `tests/e2e/shapes` and `tests/e2e/sample` converted lengths and indexes with `as`, which the lints of
  R-1 that their workspaces now hold deny, so the lint of the core failed every target. A length widens through one
  function with the reason of its conversion, an index converts with `usize::try_from`, and the integer of a data
  value is the nearest float with the reason of U-7.
- A case that armed a fault injection point of another library (`<library>.<id>`) ran against a binding crate whose
  `fault-test` turned on the feature of its own core alone, so the point of the other core was not compiled and the
  case could not arm it, and `binding check` did not report the manifest. `binding scaffold` now reads the libraries
  of the points that the case files arm, names `polyspec-<library>/fault-test` of each in `fault-test` with the
  dependency on that core, stops with the name of a library that the core does not depend on, and `binding check`
  compares the manifests with that (GN-5, CK-19). The end-to-end run builds each binding crate with the features of
  its manifest. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A contract whose `core.features.wasm` named a feature of platform I/O (`fs`, `blocking-io`, `process`, `net`) passed
  the contract check, and its WASM build failed later or built I/O that a browser does not have. `binding check` now
  reports it (CK-63), and the form of those features in a core is a row of the specification (GN-4b). Verified by
  `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The Python test of the argument count (G-7) of a member without parameters expected the words of a function with
  parameters, which CPython does not give for a function of no arguments, and WASM bound the unit result of a fallible
  member that returns nothing, which the lints deny. The test expects "takes no arguments" and "takes no keyword
  arguments" there, and WASM returns the error of such a member alone. Verified by `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/classes`.
- The generator refused the WASM binding of a host Node package, the generated Node tests of a host package imported
  the package's own entry, which is the host's code, and the end-to-end run read only `packages/rust/interface.json` at
  the paths of the plain layout. The WASM crate of a host Node package is now `native/wasm/`, the tests of a host
  package import the generated entry beside them, `binding check` asks the host's `files` for the WASM module (GN-3b),
  and the run takes every contract of the repository, `packages/rust` and `packages/<component>/rust`, each in its
  own layout (GN-14e). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts` and `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/classes`.
- The scaffold wrote a `[lints]` table of its own into each binding manifest, and a repository whose packages must take
  the lints of their workspace (`lints.workspace = true`) refused those manifests. Each binding manifest now says
  `lints.workspace = true`, so the workspace table states the lints of R-1 for the core and the bindings, and an
  exception of one crate is an attribute of its source with its reason (GN-4). The workspaces of `tests/e2e` hold the
  lints of R-1. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The end-to-end run left out a raising case that gave its receiver as an instance value (GN-13f) or whose
  arguments did not have the shape of their types, and failed only at its end; so the classes contract failed CK-22.
  Every case of the repository now runs, and a case that a target cannot write is a refusal of that target. The
  scaffold wrote the core path of the WASM crate of a host Node package (`packages/ts/native/wasm`) as `../../rust`,
  one directory short, and the WASM and Go crates did not depend on the cores of the other libraries whose types the
  contract names; each binding crate now names those cores with its path climbed by its depth below the core (L-2a,
  T-3). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- A case could make the receiver of a method only by a constructor or a static member of its own class, so a kind that
  only a receiver of earlier calls reaches had no case, and `binding check` refused the contract (CK-22). A case now
  gives its receiver as an instance value: the member that makes it (`new`), or the member whose result holds it with
  the steps to it (`from`, `pick`), its own receiver, its arguments and the calls that prepare it (`then`). Every target
  makes the instances as locals of the test, and `binding check` reports a value that breaks the form (GN-13f, CK-22).
  WASM wrote an optional field of a record through a generic conversion whose type the compiler could not infer; it
  matches the optional where it is. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts` and `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/classes`.
- WASM refused a contract with fault injection points and a record of another repository. The WASM crate now has the
  feature `fault-test` with the entry points `__armFaults` and `__faultLeft`, each core call runs with the faults that a
  test armed, the B-4 test of a case with `faults` arms them, and a record of another repository is a plain object
  converted through the core of its owner, on which the crate depends (GN-5, GN-6c). Verified by `npm test` in
  `packages/ts` and `make e2e`.
- `binding generate` wrote nothing when one target refused an item, so a contract that Go cannot take yet gave no
  binding of any target. It now generates each target by itself, writes every target that refuses nothing, names each
  refused target with its items and fails with status 2 (GN-1c). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- The value alias `data` of `tests/e2e/sample` declared the targets Go and WASM but its out rows made no Go and no
  WASM value and no in row classified one, so `binding check` failed every target of `tests/e2e/sample` and `tests/e2e/consumer` (CK-8). Each out
  row now makes the Go and the WASM value of its kind, and in rows classify those values. Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts` and `make e2e`.
- The generated tests ran only the contract cases that raise and compared no result: a member whose cases do not
  raise was called by no test. Every target now runs each such case and compares its result with the value of the
  case; the key of that value is the new `result` of the `cases` row, or `result`, and a case whose result has no
  case form fails its test by name (GN-13e, CK-22). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
- WASM generates the type `source` of a parameter, `bytes`, the defaults of parameters and record fields and error
  units, and a member with the receiver `&mut self`: the table of a class with a lock holds its value in that lock,
  and each place of a call takes its guard (GN-6h, GN-6i, GN-6j, GN-7a, GN-18, GN-18a). Every binding crate turns on
  the feature `lock` of `binding_core`. The WASM tests check a default, a source and the exact class of an error unit
  as the Node tests do (GN-13d). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts` and `make e2e` of `tests/e2e/shapes`.
- The entry `src/lib.rs` of the Go C ABI crate wrote its allow attribute on one line of 125 characters, which
  `cargo fmt --all --check` of a repository refuses; `binding scaffold` writes each allow attribute in the form of
  rustfmt (GN-3a). Verified by `npm test` in `packages/ts`.
